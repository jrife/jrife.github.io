OK, while this is *technically* true based on the [published](https://lwn.net/Articles/981559/)
statistics for the 6.10 Linux kernel, I'm hardly a core contribtor. But hey,
I wanted a catchy title.

In 6.10 I made a large number of changes to the kernel selftests for BPF
sockaddr hooks to add regression coverage for a family of issues I fixed in
prior releases, so lots of ctrl-c+ctrl-v and refactoring of existing test code 
([1](https://lore.kernel.org/bpf/20240510190246.3247730-1-jrife@google.com/T/#u),
[2](https://lore.kernel.org/bpf/20240429214529.2644801-1-jrife@google.com/T/#u)).

In this post we'll take a look at these issues, how I fixed them, and find out
a bit more about the interactions between Kubernetes, Cilium, eBPF, and Linux
Kernel, and software-defined storage such as Portworx, Longhorn, etc.
