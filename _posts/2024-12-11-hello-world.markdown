Hi, I'm Jordan. I've been meaning to set up a blog for a while mainly as a
way for me to record for posterity things that I find useful or interesting.
This is mainly for me, but if others find the content useful then even better.

As of now, I don't have a unifying theme for things I'll post, but I imagine a
lot of it will be related to things that I'm working on or that am interested
in.
